* Resized and cut the images to fit 350x300.

* Bootstrap grid fit the design well except that Bootstrap adds half a gutter to the left
  of the left-most item in a row and vice-versa for the right-most item.

* Using Aurelia framework because I believe I can make it work for this design and because I
  am playing around with it currently and because I like its simplicity.

* Using the popular swiper package to implement the image slider because it seems to have all
  the required features.

* I decided not to make smaller image sizes to be used for small-screened devices because most
  devices are wider than the image width of 350 pixels.

* Build and install from projects root folder:
  > au build --end prod
  > upload index.html  -->  webserver /index.html
  > upload scripts     -->  webserver /scripts
  > upload images      -->  webserver /images
  > upload backend     -->  webserver /backend
